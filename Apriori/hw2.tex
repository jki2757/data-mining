\section{Introduction}
The program is executable with 3 parameters: the name of the input dataset file, the threshold of minimum support count, and the name of the output file. The program creates an output a file that contains all the frequent itemsets together with their support counts. The test dataset is a synthetic dataset that contains 100,000 transactions with an average size of 10 items from a set of 1000 distinct items. 

\section{How algorithm runs}
\begin{python}
// apriori.py
oneTransaction =  infile.read().split()
unsortedTransac = list(map(int, oneTransaction)) # converts to a one-liner string of transaction
candidates_list = sorted(list(dict.fromkeys(unsortedTransac)))
\end{python}
